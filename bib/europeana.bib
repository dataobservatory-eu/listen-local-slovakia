	abstract = {This report presents the results of a collaboration between members of the {IMLS} Digital Collections and Content ({DCC}) project and developers of the Europeana Data Model ({EDM}) to construct a formal extension of {EDM} that explicitly accommodates representation of collections and collection/item relationships. The goal is to enhance the representation facilities of {EDM}, and to make {EDM} conducive to representing collection-level data from {DCC} and other digital content providers. We report on the outcomes of the collaboration – use cases, requirements, and recommendations for modeling collections in exchange and aggregation environments – prefaced by a short section covering background on the foundational {DCC} and Europeana initiatives and an overview of related work in the field.},

	abstract = {Europeana Sounds is a project co-funded by the European Commission within the {ICT} Policy Support Programme as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. The project aimed to enhance the total amount of the sound contents available through Europeana. Currently, more than 600,000 audio items and more than 300,000 audio-related contents have been aggregated thanks to the activities carried out by Europeana Sounds. The project has achieved other important objectives such as the enrichment of the metadata related to the digital objects, the realisation of a set of Policy Recommendations, the launch of the first thematic channel of Europeana entirely devoted to the music named Europeana Music and a Radio that makes 200,000 music tracks available online. Europeana Sounds will continue to pursuit its objectives through the Task force established within the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives ({IASA}). (English)},

	url = {https://bnf.hal.science/hal-01373485},
	shorttitle = {Data processing for digital libraries},
	abstract = {As one of the 24 partners of the project Europeana Sounds, the {BnF} provides to Europeana metadata related to digitized sound recordings from its cultural heritage collection. This article describes the {BnF} experience with the Europeana Sounds project by taking as its point of departure the multiple challenges related to data transformation from base material, the {MARC} {XML} records that comprise also metadata related to digital objects, into the {RDF} based Europeana Data Model ({EDM}). By way of this experience the {BnF} is exploring technical methods for exposing and sharing in the best possible way the richness and granularity of its metadata, as well sharing its areas of expertise, such as controlled vocabularies and best practices with persistent identifiers. The array of issues addressed involves instructions that combine analysis of traditional bibliographic description, digital library metadata curation, critical look on the extant relationships between various data repositories within the {BnF}, current and future role of library catalogues, metadata production workflows, role of metadata quality, licencing issues, and more. The article discusses the organization of work so that skills and responsibilities are shared in the most efficient way. It also discusses lessons learned and perspectives regarding the evolution of the profession of the metadata librarian, including the need for a better understanding of the potential for the metadata to be reused and reprocessed, and the necessity to develop modeling and technical skills. Finally, in exploratory mode, the article highlights the possibilities offered by the Linked Open Data technologies for metadata reprocessing in innovative ways by taking down the data silos borders.},
